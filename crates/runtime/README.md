# Credibil Wasm Runtime

The Credibil Wasm runtime provides a thin wrapper around [`wasmtime`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) 
for ergonomic integration of host-based services for WASI components.

We consider this a stop-gap solution until production-grade runtimes support dynamic inclusion of host-based 
services.
