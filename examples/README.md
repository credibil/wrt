# Examples

The `examples` directory contains several example projects demonstrating each WASI component
in combination with implemented resources. For example `wasi-keyvalue` combined with either
a Redis or NATS JetStream backend.

Each example includes instructions on running using `cargo run ...` or Docker Compose.
