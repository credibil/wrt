# Http-with-Cache Example

This demonstrates the feature of being able to cache responses in whatever key-value store the runtime provides (nominally Redis).

A simple HTTP server receives requests as a trigger (with examples for GET and POST). Outgoing requests are made with `Cache-Control` and `If-None-Match` headers to demonstrate how caching is controlled. (See [*Invoking a Cache*](http://...#invoking-a-cache) below)

## Quick Start

To get started add a `.env` file to the workspace root. See the `.env.example` file for a template.

In a console, build and run the `proxy` example:

```bash
# build the guest.
cargo build --example http-redis-cache --target wasm32-wasip2 --release

Run the services in Docker containers using docker compose.

```bash
docker compose --file ./examples/http-redis-cache/compose.yaml up
```

Use Postman or in a separate console, call the guest:

```bash
curl --header 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"text":"hello"}' http://localhost:8080
```

This will start a wasm runtime running a simple HTTP server instrumented with logging and metrics.

## Invoking a Cache

See the example code for 

Use a `Cache-Control` header to influence the use of a pass-through cache. The following directives are supported :

* `no-cache` - make a request to the resource and then cache the result for future requests. Usually used alongside `max-age` for key-value stores that support ttl.
* `no-store` - make a request to the resource and do not update the cache. This has the same effect as leaving out the `Cache-Control` header altogether. No other directive can be used with this one otherwise an error will be returned.
* `max-age=n` - try the cache first and return the result if it exists. If the record doesn't exist, go to the resource then cache the result with an expiry of now plus *n* seconds (for key-value stores that support ttl).

Directives are combined by separating with commas:

`Cache-Control: max-age=86400,forward=https://example.com/api/v1/records/2934875`

See [`Cache-Control` header specifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cache-Control)

If caching is invoked, an [`If-None-Match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-None-Match) header is required, otherwise an error is returned. This is used to set the cache key. Only a single ETag is supported and weak-match ETags are not supported.
