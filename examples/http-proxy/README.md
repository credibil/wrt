# HTTP Proxy Example

Demonstrates an HTTP proxy using `wasi-http` with a `wasi-keyvalue` caching layer.

This example shows how to:

- Make outgoing HTTP requests from within a WASI guest
- Implement response caching with `Cache-Control` headers
- Use ETags for cache validation

## Quick Start

```bash
# build the guest
cargo build --example http-proxy-wasm --target wasm32-wasip2

# run the host
set -a && source .env && set +a
cargo run --example http-proxy -- run ./target/wasm32-wasip2/debug/examples/http_proxy_wasm.wasm
```

## Test

```bash
curl --header 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"text":"hello"}' http://localhost:8080
```

## Implementing Caching

Use the [Cache-Control] header to influence the use of a pass-through cache. The following
directives are currently supported:

- `no-cache` - make a request to the resource and then cache the result for future requests.
  Usually used alongside `max-age` for key-value stores that support ttl.

- `no-store` - make a request to the resource and do not update the cache. This has the same
  effect as leaving out the `Cache-Control` header altogether. No other directive can be used with
  this one otherwise an error will be returned.

- `max-age=n` - try the cache first and return the result if it exists. If the record doesn't
  exist, go to the resource then cache the result with an expiry of now plus *n* seconds (for
  key-value stores that support ttl).

Multiple directives can be combined in a comma-delimited list:

```http
Cache-Control: max-age=86400,forward=https://example.com/api/v1/records/2934875
```

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, the [Cache-Control] header requires a corresponding [If-None-Match] header with a
> single `<etag_value>` to use as the cache key.

In the example guest an HTTP POST will cause an error: the [If-None-Match] header has been omitted
to demonstrate that the caching implementation requires the guest to set this header alongside the
[Cache-Control] header.
